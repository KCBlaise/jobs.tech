## OVERVIEW

### The Project
This project was made to allow professionals from various fields to find lucrative job opportunities from the comfort of their homes. From programmers to marketers, there are jobs available for everyone on Jobs.Tech.

It is powered by the Remotive API.

## PROCESS

### Technologies Used
This project was built using:
- React
- Scss
- Axios
- Javascript
- Mobile First Workflow

### API Integration
Job openings displayed on Jobs.Tech were fetched from the Remotive API using Axios.

A condition for using the Remotive API is that clients are redirected to their website, hence the redirection on clicking a displayed job.

### Styling
Elements and components were styled using Scss. This allowed for colors to be stored in variables and reused around the project. Also, it allowed for stylesheets to be imported only where required to reduce load time.

### Continued Development
I will continually look to clean up the code on this project where possible.

I will also continue to work with Sass on more projects. I intend to use functions more, as well as create more reusable mixins where possible.
